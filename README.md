A GREAT attempt at implementation of Raft in Java.  We had fun.  We fought.  We laughed.  And we Cried.  Mainly cried. To set up protocol buffers, go to google protocol buffer git hub page.  Download the zip file, and then follow the instructions in protobuf-3.5.1/README.md, protobuf-3.5.1/src/README.md/ and java/README.md.
